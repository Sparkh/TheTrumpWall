# TheTrumpWall

## Game

This game takes place at the USA and Mexico border. The USA is a strong and rich country, because of that many Mexicans want to cross the border and live in the USA. But don't worry Americans, Donald Trump is here !

With all his money, Donald Trump has been able to build a wall for stem the Mexicans migration and protect the USA. Considering everybody untrustworthy, he decided to be the only one to protect his country from the invaders.

As a player, you will control Donald Trump and stop any Mexicans who are trying to cross the border, but be careful !
If you let too much Mexicans cross the border, the US population will be angry. More the population is angry, less ammo you will get for stop the migration.


## Rules

	1) Don't let any Mexican cross the wall and the river.
	2) NEVER be out of ammo.
	3) If the population anger is at 100% and you are out of ammo, you lose.
