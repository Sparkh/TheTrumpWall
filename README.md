# TheTrumpWall
## Warning

This game doesn't represent a personnal opinion or any agreement toward the Donald Trump's ideas and politic, this game is created for showing how absurd the ideas of this man are (and more precisely the idea of build a wall between USA and Mexico).

All Mexican people (and their supporters) have all my respect and support for their fight against Donald Trump and his supporters.


## Description
### Game

This game takes place at the USA and Mexico border. The USA is a strong and rich country, because of that many Mexicans want to cross the border and live in the USA. But don't worry Americans, Donald Trump is here !

With all his money, Donald Trump has been able to build a wall for stem the Mexicans migration and protect the USA. Considering everybody untrustworthy, he decided to be the only one to protect his country from the invaders.

As a player, you will control Donald Trump and stop any Mexicans who are trying to cross the border, but be careful !
If you let too much Mexicans cross the border, the US population will be angry. More the population is angry, less ammo you will get for stop the migration.


### Rules

1. Don't let any Mexican cross the wall and the river.
2. NEVER be out of ammo.
3. If the population anger is at 100% and you are out of ammo, you lose.
